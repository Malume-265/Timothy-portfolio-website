      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>This paper examines the role of public policy in addressing national issues in Malawi, assessing whether policy responses have propelled the nation forward or hindered progress. Since the country’s transition to democracy in 1994, policymakers have introduced policies aimed at tackling major challenges, including health crises, corruption, poverty, environmental degradation, and gender inequality. The study analyses key policies such as the National AIDS Policy (2003), the National Anti-Corruption Strategy II (2020), and the National Gender Policy (2015), demonstrating how government interventions have responded to pressing social, economic, and political issues. While some of these policies have contributed to positive change, their effectiveness is often undermined by political instability, and weak monitoring and evaluation mechanisms among others. The paper argues that sustainable policy solutions require greater citizen engagement, policy continuity beyond political cycles, and improved implementation frameworks. Ultimately, the analysis highlights both the strengths and shortcomings of Malawi’s public policy landscape, emphasizing the need for reforms to ensure long-term national development.</p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>A recent report on policy development in Malawi by the National Planning Commission (2021) suggests that policies are often shaped by government decisions in response to national challenges. Political scientist Thomas Dye (2017) notes that public policies are influenced by what the government chooses to address or ignore, emphasizing the need for a critical understanding of how public policies are formed—either as a reaction to societal needs or not. Since Malawi's transition to democracy in 1994, significant changes have occurred in policymaking, leading to the formulation and adoption of numerous policies (Patel & Svasand, 2007). However, the country still faces numerous social, economic, legal and ecological problems. This write-up however, argues that public policy in Malawi, since 1994, has partially reflected the government's reaction to social, economic, and political issues, focusing on various policies adopted over time as evidence.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Public Policy Responses to National Challenges -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
      <h3>Public Policy Responses to National Challenges</h3>
      <p>Firstly, in response to the significant health challenges faced in Malawi during the late 1990s and early 2000s, the government introduced crucial health policies aimed at tackling a severe HIV/AIDS crisis (National aids commission, 2003). According to Suja and Sokai (2009), nearly one million people during the crisis were living with HIV/AIDS in a population of 12.3 million, resulting in an alarming annual death toll of 70,000 to 80,000, predominantly affecting the working population and youth. To combat this crisis, the Malawian government enacted the National AIDS Policy (NAP) in 2003, which focused on reducing HIV transmission through comprehensive education on preventive measures, such as self-testing kits and condom use, ensuring these resources were accessible across all districts. The policy also facilitated free access to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, significantly lowering the death toll and underscoring the vital role of public policy in addressing national health issues.</p>

      <p>Secondly, the formulation of anti-corruption policies was necessary to address widespread corruption, exemplified by the Cashgate scandal (Siyasiya, 2024). Siyasiya further explains that Malawi introduced anti-corruption policies to tackle the misuse of public resources. Hussein (2005) defined corruption as the abuse of public office for personal gain and noted that Malawi loses approximately $2.2 million annually due to reported cases of corruption. The Cashgate scandal, as presented to the Global Expert Group Meeting on Corruption by Chiwala (2018), highlighted that between 2009 and 2014, the country lost around $356 million to corruption. Public frustration led to the introduction of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy II (NACS II) in 2020, a policy aimed at empowering institutions like the Anti-Corruption Bureau and increasing public involvement in identifying and reporting corruption. This policy underscores the government’s efforts to effectively enforce anti-corruption laws.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the government adopted developmental policies and goals to address extreme poverty and underdevelopment. The Malawi Fourth Integrated Household Survey (IHS4) from 2016-2017 revealed that poverty remained a significant national challenge, with over 51.5% of the population living below the poverty line and 20.1% living in extreme poverty (National Statistics Office, 2017). In response to this public challenge, the government introduced several policies targeting the growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises (Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, 2019). The idea was to alleviate extreme poverty by increasing access to finance, markets, and business information and skills.</p>

      <p>Lastly, in post-1994 Malawi, environmental degradation emerged as a pressing public problem, forcing the government to act with policy changes (World Bank, 2019). This degradation had severe effects, including climate change (Ngwira, 2019). For instance, the World Bank (2019) reported that up to 60% of Malawi's land was affected by soil erosion, with half of the country’s forests disappearing. The report, coupled with public outcry, accelerated the government’s need to address such issues in collaboration with the United Nations (UN Environment Programme, 2022). They strengthened and renewed the 2004 National Environmental Policy (NEP) strategies, outlining solutions to address environmental issues, such as facilitating local community participation in afforestation of bare areas and proper waste discharge and treatment (National Planning Commission, 2021). Thus, the government’s response to environmental degradation serves as evidence that public policies are government actions in response to public problems.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the government addressed the disparity between policy and practice regarding gender equality in the country (Malawi Government, 2015). The adoption of the Gender Equality Policy was a reaction to national outcry over women’s inequality (Mtike, 2022). Lovell (2021) argues that although gender equality is enshrined in Section 13 of the constitution, which prohibits discrimination on any basis, gender inequality remains deeply rooted and persistent in the country’s beliefs. In 2021, Malawi ranked 115 out of 156 countries in Africa in terms of gender inequality. For instance, the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey indicated that many women scored poorly in areas such as asset ownership and education (National Statistics Office, 2010). In response, the public demanded a more inclusive and fair involvement of women in affairs (Amakoh, Faiaz, Rao et al., 2023). Consequently, the government formulated and adopted the National Gender Policy in 2015 (Ministry of Gender, Children, Disability, and Social Welfare, 2015), which aimed to promote women’s participation in politics and decision-making roles and enhance their economic empowerment through access to productive resources.</p>

    <!-- Challenges in Policy Implementation -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      <h3>Challenges in Policy Implementation</h3>
      <p>Public policies do not always respond effectively to Malawi's national problems. One significant issue is the disconnect between government policies and actual needs (Cammack, 2014). Cammack further explains that this challenge arises from a lack of public participation in policymaking, which has long been a significant issue. Policy decisions are often made through a top-down approach, with minimal consultation of citizens, particularly in rural areas where people are most affected by these policies (Kayuni, 2019). This absence of meaningful involvement results in policies that fail to reflect the lived experiences and priorities of the broader public, as seen in the ineffective implementation of agricultural subsidies and health reforms (Chipeta, 2020). Strengthening mechanisms for citizen involvement in policy development could enhance both policy relevance and public trust (Falanga & Ferrao, 2021).</p>

      <p>Another challenge is the instability and inconsistency in addressing public problems (Nwankwo, 2020). These instabilities stem from frequent changes in government and leadership (Aiyende & Muganda, 2023). Each new administration tends to abandon or significantly revise the policies of its predecessors to align with their political manifestos, resulting in a lack of continuity and long-term focus (Cammack, 2017). This inconsistency is evident in sectors like agriculture and education, where policy shifts disrupt the implementation of key programs, such as the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP), which has undergone multiple reforms with each new government (Chinsinga, 2023). The lack of policy stability hampers sustainable development, as strategies are often short-term and politically motivated rather than grounded in long-term national interests (Dulani & Chunga, 2021). For instance, policies aimed at decentralization have been inconsistently applied, weakening local governance structures (Chilunjika & Manda, 2021). Establishing consistent policy frameworks that transcend political changes is critical for addressing Malawi's developmental challenges (Kalemba, 2022).</p>

      <p>Lastly, there are weak monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms for proper policy evaluation (Cammack, 2004). The assessment of policy effectiveness is often hindered, leading to a multitude of policies that fail to address current social problems (Dye, 2017) and insufficient follow-up once policies are implemented. There is little emphasis on M&E, which is particularly problematic in sectors like health and education, where the absence of robust evaluation frameworks prevents stakeholders from determining whether policies are improving service delivery (Cammack, 2017). Without comprehensive data collection and analysis, informed decision-making becomes challenging, contributing to repeated policy failures (Dulani & Chunga, 2021). To improve policy outcomes, it is crucial for the Malawian government to prioritize M&E as a core component of policy development.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, nearly all public policy actions taken in Malawi since 1994 have been shaped by the government’s response to national challenges, such as health, corruption, poverty, and environmental degradation. For example, the formulation of the National AIDS Policy, strategies to combat corruption, and poverty alleviation programs are some of the ways the government has sought to address these challenges. Dye (2017) observes that public policy is defined by what the government does or does not engage in, which is evident in Malawi's policy landscape. Nevertheless, these policies tend to provide solutions even amid minimal public participation, unstable political environments, and ineffective monitoring and evaluation systems. These conditions sometimes lead to policies that address people's problems but do not ensure sustainability. To mitigate policy challenges, citizen engagement in policy issues should be increased, political changes should be managed without policy disruptions, and evaluation systems should be established to enhance policy implementation in Malawi.</p>
